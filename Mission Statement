In an effort to brush up on key C++ concepts, Ill be going through Bjarneâ€™s  "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++". 
My goal is to both elucidate the more confusing aspects of the book through explanation of the chapters and exercises 
and improve through teaching. 

If anyone has any suggestions that could be used to improve this, feel free to leave any feedback or tips.
