In an effort to brush up on key C++ concepts, Ill be going through Bjarnes "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++". 
My goal is to both elucidate the more confusing aspects of the book through explination of the chapters and exercises 
and improve through teaching. 

If another user who uses this resource, feel free to leave any feedback or tips on how things can be improved.
